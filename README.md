D: is a PC drive letter often assigned to the CD-ROM or other disc drive. Computers with one hard drive and partition automatically assign the CD-ROM or other disc drive as the D: drive. However, this drive can be any drive letter, but is often assigned as the last physical drive letter. The picture below is an example of the DVD-RW drive, which is assigned as the E: drive.

## D Drive Functionalities

It varies from computer to computer. In the computer which is running on Microsoft operating system has a hard drive which is the C: drive. C: drive is the first available drive letter for the hard drives. Generally, the computer assigns A: drive B: drive for the floppy disks. Sometimes, A: and B: drives are assigned to removable media like tape drives. If you install other drives or create a partition on the installed hard drive, they will be assigned the drive letter D, E, F, and so on.

Suppose your computer comes with a hard drive and a disk drive such as CD-ROM, or DVD drive. In this configuration, the C: drive will be the hard drive, and the D: drive will be your disk drive. Now the question should arise what about the A: and B: drive. Though no floppy disk is installed, as a convention, A: and B: drive letters to remain reserved for the floppy disk drive.
But today, this convention is not followed most of the time. For example, my computer is running on Windows 10, and I have two partitions on my hard drive. The system drive of my computer is the C: drive and the other driver is my A: drive. Though I have no floppy disk installed on my computer.
